# time_tradingday

**Category:** Variable

**Type:** `series int`

## Description

The timestamp that represents 00:00 UTC of the trading day the current bar belongs to, in UNIX format (the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970).

## Remarks

This variable is helpful when working with overnight sessions, where the day's session can begin on the previous calendar day. For example, on the "FXCM:EURUSD" symbol, the Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00, exchange time. Unlike `time`, which returns the timestamp for Sunday at 17:00 on the Monday daily bar, `time_tradingday` returns the timestamp for Monday at 00:00 UTC. When used on timeframes higher than "1D", `time_tradingday` returns the timestamp of the last trading day inside that bar (e.g., on "1W", it returns the timestamp of the final trading day within the week).

## Examples

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Friday session")

//@variable The day of week, based on the current `time_tradingday` value. 
//          Uses "UTC+0" to return the daily session's timestamp at 00:00 UTC. 
int tradingDayOfWeek = dayofweek(time_tradingday, "UTC+0")

//@variable Returns `true` if the `dayofweek` represents Friday, in exchange time.
//          It might never return `true` on overnight symbols, depending on the timeframe, since the Friday session
//          starts on Thursday.
bool isFriday = dayofweek == dayofweek.friday
//@variable Returns `true` if the `tradingDayOfWeek` is Friday. 
//          Differs from `isFriday` on symbols with overnight sessions and for timeframes > "1D" on others.
bool isFridaySession = tradingDayOfWeek == dayofweek.friday

// Create a horizontal line at the `dayofweek.friday` value.
hline(dayofweek.friday, "Friday value", color.gray, hline.style_dashed, 2)
// Plot the `dayofweek` and `tradingDayOfWeek` for comparison.
plot(dayofweek, "Day of week", color.blue, 2)
plot(tradingDayOfWeek, "Trading day", color.teal, 3)
// Highlight the background when `isFriday` and `isFridaySession` occur.
bgcolor(isFriday ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na, title = "isFriday highlight")
bgcolor(isFridaySession ? color.new(color.teal, 80) : na, title = "isFridaySession highlight")
```
