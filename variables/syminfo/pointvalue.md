# syminfo.pointvalue

**Category:** Variable

**Type:** `simple float`

## Description

The chart price of a security multiplied by the point value equals the actual price of the traded security.

For all types of security except futures, the point value is usually equal to 1 and can therefore be ignored. For futures, the prices shown on the chart are either the cost of a single futures contract, in which case the point value is 1, or the price of a single unit of the underlying commodity, in which case the point value represents the number of units included in a single contract.

For example, the price of the "COMEX:GC1!" gold futures chart reflects the price of a single troy ounce of gold. However, a single GC futures contract comprises 100 troy ounces, as defined by the COMEX exchange. So when the price on the "GC1!" chart is 2000 USD, a single contract costs 2000 USD * 100 troy ounces = 200,000 USD. This calculation is important in backtesting, because the strategy engine takes the point value into account, and does not open a position if there is not enough capital.

The point value is also displayed in the Security Info window for a given asset.
